# Assignment 1

I decided to do this assignment using Python. Private members are represented with a _ preceding the variable/function name. Variables/functions are assumed to be public if there is no _ preceding their name

## Install Requirements

- The root directory contains the main.py file. CD into that directory

- Run the command:
`
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
`

## Usage
- To begin the program run the command:
`
python3 main.py
`

#### Notes
- The file located at dataFiles/dataFile.xlsx relative to the root directory acts as the database and persists the data from run-to-run
